# CNN-based-VGG16-
For image analysis

This code file contains image analysis process for identifying Ai generated images using CNN-based VGG16 model.
VGG16 is a pretrained CNN model which was trained over 14 million images from nearly 1,000 classes. Due to which it can classify images into 1,000 object categories.
Here we used fine-tuned version of it with final two layers been freezed.
